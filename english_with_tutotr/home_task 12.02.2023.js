Чому важливо підтримувати здоровий спосіб життя ?

I read this text.
Most of what is written is good advice, but for me is difficult to follow these rules.
For example heve breakfast  at 8.00. I can not did this because 
i do not have usually appetite at this time, and my body does not  want to accept any food.

About coffe in the morning. 
For coffe do not take any effect and it does not matter morning or evening.
This is if we talk about the fact that coffee invigorates.
But I try to drink coffee very rarely as it has a big effect on my blood pressure, which leads to frequent headaches.

As for lunch, I have nothing to add here, I have lunch on my schedule between 13.00 and 14.00.

As for my dinner.I usually have dinner at 19.00 when i come back to home from work.
But i have a bad habit, it to eat extra before i go to bed.
Maybe this bad habit it reason why i do not have appetite in the morning.

As for glass of wine before dinner.To my mind this is bad idea.Alcohol its mostly bad.

About sport. I do not have time for it.because i have 2 jobs, after work i have chores at home.
As stated at the beginning of the text, the 21st century is super-busy.
